The goal is not only to create an accurate map but also to understand the end-to-end workflow of a geospatial deep learning project, from foundational data analysis to training and evaluating advanced neural network architectures like the U-Net.\n",

        "**The core challenge:** Can we train a model on recent, high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to predict historical forest change categories derived from the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset? This would create a powerful tool for near-real-time monitoring."

To address this, we now implement a more advanced architecture: the **U-Net**. The U-Net's encoder-decoder structure with skip connections is the industry standard for semantic segmentation and is specifically designed to produce clean, spatially precise prediction maps."

        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This project successfully developed and rigorously evaluated an end-to-end pipeline for semantic segmentation of deforestation in Nepal. Our methodical, comparative analysis of four distinct experimental setups yielded clear and actionable insights:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Class Imbalance is the Dominant Challenge:** A baseline `SimpleFCN` model achieved a misleadingly high **Overall Accuracy of 86.82%** by completely ignoring the minority \"Deforested\" class, resulting in an **F1-Score of 0.0**.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Weighted Loss is an Effective Countermeasure:** By introducing a `WeightedCrossEntropyLoss`, we successfully forced the model to learn the minority class, boosting the **Recall for \"Deforested\" from 0% to 58%**. This demonstrated a direct solution to the primary problem, albeit at the cost of precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Advanced Architectures Improve Spatial Cohesion:** The `U-Net` architecture produced visually superior, more spatially coherent prediction maps compared to the noisy FCN outputs. However, its increased complexity led to training instability with a high learning rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Stabilization is Key to Performance:** The winning model was the **`Stable U-Net`**, which combined the advanced U-Net architecture with the weighted loss function and a `ReduceLROnPlateau` learning rate scheduler. This model achieved the best balance of performance across all classes, with a final **Mean IoU of 0.465**. The key finding was that addressing class imbalance via weighted loss was essential, boosting the Recall for the 'Deforested' class from 0% to over 40%.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key remaining challenge is the low **precision** on the \"Deforested\" class, where the winning model still confuses naturally bright surfaces like riverbeds with cleared land, as evidenced by the qualitative visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Future Work\n",
        "\n",
        "To further improve performance, future experiments could include:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Advanced Architectures (e.g., Vision Transformer):** The primary weakness of our best model is a lack of global context. A Transformer-based segmentation architecture, such as **SegFormer**, could be implemented. Its self-attention mechanism is ideally suited to learn the long-range spatial relationships needed to distinguish a long, winding river from a small, isolated deforestation patch, directly targeting the precision problem.\n",
        "*   **Data Augmentation:** Applying random geometric and color augmentations to the training data to improve model robustness and generalization.\n",
        "*   **Post-Processing:** Using techniques like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to clean up and refine the final prediction maps based on the spatial relationships of the predictions themselves."
